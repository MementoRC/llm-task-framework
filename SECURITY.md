## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the LLM Task Framework seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report privately

Send an email to [security@yourdomain.com] with:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 3. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 1 week
- **Fix timeline**: Varies based on severity (24 hours to 90 days)

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for known vulnerabilities
- **Secret Detection**: Automated scanning for exposed secrets
- **Container Security**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **License Compliance**: Automated license compatibility checking

### Development Security

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Security scanning before code commits
- **Dependency pinning**: Locked dependency versions
- **Minimal permissions**: Least-privilege principle in CI/CD
- **Regular updates**: Automated dependency updates via Dependabot

### LLM API Security

- **API key rotation**: Regular rotation of LLM provider API keys
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for API calls
- **Input validation**: Strict validation of user inputs
- **Output sanitization**: Sanitization of LLM responses

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management

```python
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables
import os
api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")  # pragma: allowlist secret

# ❌ Bad: Hard-code API keys
api_key = "sk-ant-api03-..."  # pragma: allowlist secret
```

### Input Validation

```python
# ✅ Good: Validate inputs
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class TaskInput(BaseModel):
    prompt: str

    @validator('prompt')
    def validate_prompt(cls, v):
        if len(v) > 10000:
            raise ValueError('Prompt too long')
        return v

# ❌ Bad: Accept raw inputs
def process_task(raw_input):
    # No validation
    pass
```

### Secure Configuration

```python
# ✅ Good: Use secure defaults
config = {
    "timeout": 30,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "validate_responses": True
}

# ❌ Bad: Disable security features
config = {
    "timeout": None,
    "validate_responses": False
}
```

## Vulnerability Categories

We prioritize vulnerabilities based on the following categories:

### Critical (24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- API key exposure
- Data exfiltration

### High (1 week)
- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection (if applicable)
- Cross-site scripting
- Denial of service

### Medium (2-4 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Insecure defaults

### Low (1-3 months)
- Minor information leaks
- Non-exploitable edge cases

## Security Updates

Security updates are distributed via:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- PyPI package updates
- Release notes with security flags
- Email notifications to registered users

## Compliance

This project aims to comply with:
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls (for enterprise deployments)

## Security Hardening

### For Production Deployments

1. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Use VPN for internal communications

2. **Container Security**
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Use minimal base images
   - Regularly update container images
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Use strong authentication methods
   - Enable audit logging
   - Regular access reviews

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up security monitoring
   - Enable alerting for suspicious activities
   - Regular security assessments
   - Incident response procedures

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing (quarterly)
- Code reviews with security focus
- Threat modeling exercises
- Red team exercises (annually)

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update dependencies:
- **Automated scanning**: Daily vulnerability checks
- **Update policy**: Security patches within 48 hours
- **Review process**: Manual review for major updates
- **Rollback plan**: Quick rollback for problematic updates

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **Security Email**: [security@yourdomain.com]
- **GPG Key**: Available upon request
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for initial response

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers who help improve our security posture.
